          "direction": "Directions (3-12): Read the following passage and answer the given questions.\n\nOver the past two decades, research has emphasized the importance of accessible communication and inclusive programs for people with disabilities. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1.3 billion people globally live with some form of disability, with communication barriers ranking among the most significant challenges. For individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, sign language remains a primary communication tool. Studies from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders show that early exposure to sign language enhances cognitive skills, literacy, and social integration.\n\nHowever, barriers such as a shortage of trained interpreters and limited public awareness persist. In 2017, a targeted study involving 20 individuals with hearing impairments revealed that while basic signs were widely understood, comprehension dropped when regional variations or complex grammatical structures were used, pointing to the need for standardized learning and broader public training.\n\nTo address these gaps, several disability-focused associations have implemented bold initiatives, including large-scale sign language training for both disabled and non-disabled individuals. This direct approach fosters mutual understanding and reduces social isolation.\n\nRecent research also highlights the growing role of music-based interventions in disability support. While commonly associated with auditory experiences, music therapy leverages rhythm, vibration, and movement to stimulate multiple senses. The Journal of Music Therapy reports that tactile vibrations from instruments—particularly percussion—can be felt and enjoyed by those with hearing impairments. For individuals with mobility or cognitive challenges, structured music activities improve coordination, memory, and emotional well-being.\n\nMusic therapy extends beyond passive listening. Interactive methods such as drumming circles, rhythm exercises, and movement-to-music sessions encourage active engagement. Neurological studies indicate these activities promote neuroplasticity, strengthening brain connections and aiding rehabilitation for those adapting to long-term disabilities.\n\nMany associations have joined international collaborations to share expertise on combining communication tools with creative therapies. Global reports confirm that integrating sign language accessibility with music-based programs leads to measurable improvements in social participation, self-confidence, and mental health.\n\nIn conclusion, evidence strongly supports combining accessible communication with sensory-inclusive activities like music therapy. By merging research-backed strategies with community engagement, organizations can create inclusive environments that empower individuals with disabilities to participate fully and thrive.",
