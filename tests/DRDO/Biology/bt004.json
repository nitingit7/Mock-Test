      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Most ancient bird of Jurassic age (A)**\n\nArchaeopteryx lithographica (discovered in 1861 from Solnhofen limestone, Germany) is the earliest known bird from the Late Jurassic period (~150 million years ago). It is a perfect transitional fossil showing reptilian features (teeth, long bony tail, clawed fingers) and avian features (feathers, wings, wishbone). This discovery provided strong evidence for Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and the dinosaur-bird link. In DRDO CEPTAM-11, such questions test understanding of palaeontology, transitional fossils, and evolutionary biology — crucial for defence research in biometrics, biomaterials, and bio-inspired engineering (e.g., lightweight structures from bird anatomy).\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **(A) Most ancient bird of Jurassic age:** Correct — it is universally accepted as the first bird in the fossil record.\n• **(B) Reptile of Jurassic period:** Incorrect — although it has reptilian traits, it is classified as a bird (Aves) due to feathers and flight capability.\n• **(C) Reptile of Triassic period:** Incorrect — wrong geological period (Triassic ended 201 mya; Archaeopteryx is Jurassic).\n• **(D) Reptile of both Triassic and Jurassic period:** Incorrect — it existed only in Late Jurassic and is not purely a reptile."

      "options": ["Amphibia and Aves", "Reptilia and Aves", "Reptilia and Mammalia", "Aves and Mammalia"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Reptilia and Aves (B)**\n\nArchaeopteryx is the classic example of a transitional fossil linking reptiles (especially theropod dinosaurs) and birds (class Aves). It had reptilian skeleton (teeth, long tail, claws) but possessed feathers and wings like modern birds. This discovery (post-Darwin) strongly supported the theory of evolution and the dinosaurian origin of birds. For DRDO aspirants, this tests conceptual understanding of phylogeny, fossil evidence, and evolutionary transitions — topics that appear in General Science for bio-inspired defence technologies (e.g., drone wing design from avian evolution).\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **(A) Amphibia and Aves:** Incorrect — amphibians to birds transition is much earlier (via reptiles).\n• **(B) Reptilia and Aves:** Correct — direct link between dinosaurs (reptiles) and birds.\n• **(C) Reptilia and Mammalia:** Incorrect — mammals evolved separately from synapsid reptiles.\n• **(D) Aves and Mammalia:** Incorrect — no direct link; both are endothermic but separate lineages."

      "options": ["Dog", "Horse", "Camel", "Elephant"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Elephant (D)**\n\nThe Woolly Mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct relative and direct ancestor of modern elephants (genus Elephas and Loxodonta). Genetic studies (2010s) confirm that Asian elephants share ~99.5% DNA with mammoths. They lived during the Pleistocene Ice Age and became extinct ~4,000 years ago. This question tests knowledge of megafauna extinction and mammalian evolution — relevant for DRDO in biodiversity, climate change impact studies, and bio-materials research (ivory-like structures).\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **(A) Dog, (B) Horse, (C) Camel:** All belong to different mammalian orders (Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla) with no relation to Proboscidea (elephants & mammoths)."

      "options": ["Cenozoic reptiles", "Mesozoic birds", "Paleozoic amphibians", "Mesozoic reptiles"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Mesozoic reptiles (D)**\n\nDinosaurs were a diverse group of archosaurian reptiles that dominated the Earth during the entire Mesozoic Era (Triassic 252–201 mya, Jurassic 201–145 mya, Cretaceous 145–66 mya) — famously called the “Age of Reptiles”. They became extinct at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary due to asteroid impact and volcanism. This is fundamental knowledge for DRDO CEPTAM General Science as it covers geological time scale, mass extinctions, and evolutionary biology — topics linked to defence research in extreme environments and materials inspired by dinosaur bone structure.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **(A) Cenozoic reptiles:** Cenozoic is “Age of Mammals” after dinosaur extinction.\n• **(B) Mesozoic birds:** Birds evolved from dinosaurs but dinosaurs themselves were reptiles.\n• **(C) Paleozoic amphibians:** Paleozoic is “Age of Amphibians & Fishes” (pre-dinosaurs)."

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Mesozoic era (C)**\n\nThe Mesozoic Era (252–66 million years ago) is known as the “Age of Reptiles” because dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and marine reptiles flourished during this time. It is divided into Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. The era ended with the mass extinction event that wiped out non-avian dinosaurs. For DRDO exams, this tests precise knowledge of geological time scale, which is important for understanding Earth history, resource exploration, and climate modelling in strategic defence applications.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Paleozoic (A):** Age of fishes and amphibians (pre-dinosaurs).\n• **Cenozoic (B):** Age of mammals (post-dinosaur extinction).\n• **Pleistocene (D):** A short epoch within Cenozoic (Ice Age, human evolution)."

      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: 4 3 1 2 (B)**\n\nCorrect matching: (a) Theory of mutation → Hugo de Vries (4), (b) Theory of evolution → Darwin (3), (c) One gene one enzyme hypothesis → Beadle & Tatum (1), (d) Operon concept → Jacob & Monod (2). This matching tests key milestones in evolutionary and molecular biology. For DRDO CEPTAM-11, such questions evaluate understanding of historical development of genetics and molecular biology, which underpin modern biotechnology and defence-related research in genomics and synthetic biology.\n\n**Why important for DRDO:** These concepts are foundational for genetic engineering, vaccine development, and bio-defence technologies."

      "text": "Which one of the following statements is not correct?",
      "options": ["All echinoderms are viviparous", "Roundworm has no circulatory system", "In bony fishes, swim bladder is usually present", "In cartilaginous fishes, fertilization is internal"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: All echinoderms are viviparous (A)**\n\nMost echinoderms (starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers) are oviparous with external fertilization. Only a few species show brooding or viviparity. The other statements are correct: roundworms (nematodes) are pseudocoelomates without true circulatory system; bony fishes have swim bladder for buoyancy; cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays) have internal fertilization. This question tests precise knowledge of animal physiology and reproduction — frequently asked in DRDO for understanding marine biology and bio-materials (echinoderm regeneration inspires self-healing materials).\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **(A):** Incorrect — majority are oviparous.\n• **(B,C,D):** All factually correct."

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Starfish (A)**\n\nStarfish (phylum Echinodermata) is a marine invertebrate with radial symmetry and water vascular system — not a fish. Sawfish, pipefish, and guitarfish are all true fishes (class Chondrichthyes or Osteichthyes) with gills, fins, and vertebral column. This distinction is important in taxonomy and appears in DRDO exams to test classification skills, relevant for marine defence, bio-mimicry, and underwater robotics.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **(A) Starfish:** Echinoderm — not a vertebrate fish.\n• **(B,C,D):** All are cartilaginous or bony fishes."

      "options": ["Fungi", "Plants", "Insects", "Bacteria"],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Insects (C)**\n\nInsects (class Insecta, phylum Arthropoda) are the most diverse group on Earth with over 1 million described species (estimated 5–10 million total) — more than half of all known animal species. Their success is due to small size, rapid reproduction, metamorphosis, and adaptability. This fact is crucial for DRDO CEPTAM in biodiversity, entomology (pest control, bio-weapons defence), and bio-inspired engineering (insect flight for micro-drones).\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Fungi, Plants, Bacteria:** All have fewer described species compared to insects."

      "text": "Warm-blooded animals are those which are able to keep their body temperature",
      "options": ["Lower than environment", "Higher than environment", "Constant temp. all time", "Equal to the atmospheric temp."],
      "correctIndex": 2,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Constant temp. all time (C)**\n\nWarm-blooded (homeothermic or endothermic) animals — birds and mammals — maintain a constant internal body temperature (e.g., 37°C in humans) independent of external environment through metabolic heat production, insulation (fur/feathers), and physiological mechanisms (sweating, shivering). This allows activity in extreme climates but demands high energy. Cold-blooded animals (poikilotherms) fluctuate with surroundings. This concept is vital for DRDO in human factors engineering, soldier performance in extreme environments, and bio-mimicry.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **(C):** Precise definition of homeothermy."

      "options": ["Silverfish", "Crayfish", "Jellyfish", "Catfish"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Catfish (D)**\n\nCatfish (order Siluriformes) are true bony fishes (class Osteichthyes) with gills, fins, scales, and vertebral column. Silverfish is an insect (Thysanura), crayfish is a crustacean (Arthropoda), and jellyfish is a cnidarian (invertebrate). True fishes belong to superclass Pisces — a key taxonomic distinction tested in DRDO for understanding vertebrate classification and aquatic ecosystems in naval research.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **(A,B,C):** All invertebrates or non-fish."

      "options": ["Starfish", "Jellyfish", "Dogfish", "Seahorse"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Seahorse (D)**\n\nSeahorse (Hippocampus) is a true bony fish (order Syngnathiformes) with gills, fins, and swim bladder. Dogfish is a shark (cartilaginous fish). Starfish and jellyfish are invertebrates. Seahorses are unique for male pregnancy and upright swimming — excellent example of specialized fish adaptation. Important for DRDO marine biology and bio-mimicry (seahorse tail for flexible robotics)."

      "options": ["Whale", "African Elephant", "Hippopotamus", "Polar bear"],
      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Whale (A)**\n\nThe blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal ever known (up to 33 m long, 200 tonnes) — larger than any dinosaur. All whales are marine mammals (order Cetacea). This fact highlights extreme size variation in Mammalia and is relevant for DRDO in marine research, bio-acoustics, and understanding large-animal physiology."

      "options": ["Fishes", "Mammals", "Reptiles", "Amphibians"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Mammals (B)**\n\nWhales are fully aquatic mammals that evolved from terrestrial artiodactyl ancestors ~50 million years ago (Pakicetus). They have lungs, warm blood, mammary glands, and give live birth. This is a classic example of secondary aquatic adaptation in evolution — tested in DRDO for understanding convergent evolution and marine mammal research."

      "text": "Which one is a mammal?",
      "options": ["Shark", "Squid", "Octopus", "Whale"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Whale (D)**\n\nOnly whale is a mammal (class Mammalia). Shark is a cartilaginous fish, squid and octopus are cephalopod molluscs. Mammals are defined by mammary glands, hair/fur, three middle ear bones, and neocortex — key traits for DRDO human factors and comparative physiology studies."
