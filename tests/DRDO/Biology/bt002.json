      "text": "Darwin's theory of natural selection is based on",
      "options": ["Over production", "Struggle for existence and variation", "Survival of the fittest", "All of the above"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: All of the above (D)**\n\n**Deep Explanation:** Darwin’s theory of natural selection rests on four key postulates: (1) Overproduction of offspring, (2) Struggle for existence due to limited resources, (3) Variation among individuals, and (4) Survival of the fittest (those with advantageous variations reproduce more). These together lead to descent with modification and evolution.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Over production (A):** Populations produce more offspring than can survive.\n• **Struggle for existence and variation (B):** Competition + heritable differences.\n• **Survival of the fittest (C):** Differential reproductive success.\n• **All of the above (D):** Complete and accurate foundation of Darwinism."

      "text": "Who propounded the theory of evolution?",
      "options": ["Spencer", "Darwin", "Wallace", "Huxley"],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Darwin (B)**\n\n**Deep Explanation:** Charles Darwin (with Alfred Russel Wallace) independently proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859 in “On the Origin of Species”. Darwin provided the most comprehensive evidence and mechanism.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Spencer (A):** Coined “survival of the fittest” but did not propose natural selection.\n• **Wallace (C):** Co-discoverer, but Darwin is credited as the primary propounder.\n• **Huxley (D):** “Darwin’s bulldog” — defender, not originator."

      "text": "According to recent proof, the life on earth emerged approximately",
      "options": ["Before 20,000 years", "Before 2,00,000 years", "Before 20,00,000 years", "Before 2,000,000,000 years"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Before 2,000,000,000 years (D)**\n\n**Deep Explanation:** Fossil evidence (stromatolites) and molecular clocks show life originated ~3.5–4.0 billion years ago; the question’s “recent proof” aligns with ~2 billion years as a conservative estimate for prokaryotic life dominance. This is critical for understanding abiogenesis and early Earth conditions.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **20,000 / 2,00,000 / 20,00,000 years (A,B,C):** Far too recent — human history scale.\n• **2,000,000,000 years (D):** Matches geological and biochemical evidence."

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Blue-green algae (A)**\n\n**Deep Explanation:** Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the oldest known living organisms, with fossil evidence (stromatolites) dating back ~3.5 billion years. They performed oxygenic photosynthesis, changing Earth’s atmosphere.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Fungi (B):** Appeared ~1 billion years ago.\n• **Amoeba & Euglena (C,D):** Much later eukaryotic protists (~1.5–2 billion years)."

      "text": "Who explained first the evolution of life?",
      "options": ["Newton", "Einstein", "Charles Darwin", "Lamarck"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Lamarck (D)**\n\n**Deep Explanation:** Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1809) was the first to propose a coherent theory of evolution (“Philosophie Zoologique”) based on use and disuse of organs and inheritance of acquired characters. Darwin later provided the mechanism of natural selection.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Newton & Einstein (A,B):** Physics, not biology.\n• **Charles Darwin (C):** Gave the most accepted mechanism (1859)."

      "options": ["Huxley", "Darwin", "Lamarck", "Hugo de Vries"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Hugo de Vries (D)**\n\n**Deep Explanation:** Hugo de Vries (1901) proposed the Mutation Theory based on sudden, large, heritable changes (mutations) in Oenothera lamarckiana, challenging gradualism of Darwin.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Huxley (A):** Supporter of Darwin.\n• **Darwin (B):** Gradual variation.\n• **Lamarck (C):** Acquired characters."

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Salamander - Python - Kangaroo (C)**\n\n**Deep Explanation:** This follows vertebrate evolutionary sequence: Amphibia (Salamander) → Reptilia (Python) → Mammalia (Kangaroo). It reflects the correct phylogenetic progression from water to land to advanced mammals.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• Others mix invertebrates/vertebrates or reverse evolutionary order."

      "options": ["Mutation", "Achieved quality", "Vaginal birth", "Natural selection"],
      "correctIndex": 3,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Natural selection (D)**\n\n**Deep Explanation:** Natural selection is the primary driving force of adaptive evolution as per Darwin — differential survival and reproduction of individuals with favourable variations.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Mutation (A):** Source of variation, not the main factor.\n• **Achieved quality & Vaginal birth (B,C):** Not evolutionary mechanisms."

      "correctIndex": 0,
      "solution": "✅ **Correct Answer: Use and disuse of organs (A)**\n\n**Deep Explanation:** This is a classic example from Lamarck’s theory — organs not used (limbs in burrowing snakes) gradually reduce and disappear over generations.\n\n**Option-wise Analysis:**\n• **Natural selection (C):** Darwinian explanation (advantageous for burrowing).\n• Others are related but not the direct phenomenon asked."
